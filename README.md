AI-MedX: AI-Powered Cardiovascular Disease Diagnosis  

ðŸš€ Overview  
This project is developed for the **AI-MedX Competition**, focusing on early diagnosis of **cardiovascular diseases using ECG data**. We leverage **deep learning models (CNNs & RNNs)** to analyze ECG signals and classify arrhythmias efficiently.  

ðŸ“Š Dataset  
We used the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset** from **PhysioNet**, which contains annotated ECG signals for arrhythmia detection.  
- **Source**: [PhysioNet Database](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/)  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Resampling, noise filtering, normalization.  

ðŸ”¬ AI Model  
We implemented a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) + Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** for ECG signal classification.  
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch (alternative)  
- **Layers Used**: Conv1D, LSTM, GRU  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC
